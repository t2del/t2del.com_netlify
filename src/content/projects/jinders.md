About Jinder’s & Ms. K Kaur
A leading store for Indian fusion-wear and fashion in one of Singapore’s most vibrant districts, Little India, Jinder’s specializes in exclusive womenswear collections from bridal couture, Indian fashion pret-a-porter and haute couture, made to measure classic outfits and sarees, to stunning fashion jewelry.

With a humble beginning back in 1995, Mrs Kuljinder Kaur ran a one-woman business straight from her garage and has always stood by her belief in authenticity, good quality products, purity and truth. A one-of-a-kind stylist, she is known for her unique talent of recommending accurate sizing and outfit style based on clients personalities and physical features on first look.

For over two decades, Jinder’s have built a reputation for unmatched craftsmanship, design, bespoke quality and customer service with a loyal clientele in Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, Indonesia, and the United States.

Aside from our wide array of bridal, bridesmaid, designer and casual collections, we also specialize in fabrics, jewelry (Indian bridal sets and western cocktail accessories), and tailoring services in-house, saving you the time and hassle of dealing with external tailors
